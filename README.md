Kubyt Client Public Files

Here is a quick tutorial on how to display your players DISPLAY name (meaning if your nametag is changed, it will showup):

1) Head over to net.minecraft.client.renderer.entity.Render.java
2) Search for the 'DoRender' Method and right after 'this.renderName(entity, x, y, z);', paste in the file associated with this READ-ME.

All done! Enjoy :)
